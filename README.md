# Toroid flat mapping conceptualizer + computing tools

#### [Codepen demo](https://codepen.io/mootytootyfrooty/pen/RNWQvXB)

I am working on tiling noise textures which are just the 4th dimensional value of a manifold in 3d space, so if you walk in a periodic topology you can get tileable textures. 

I used a similar concept to walk a sphere to get a continuous spherical noise texture, but in the toroidal case you can get a perfect square uv map texture by walking over a toroid, which has repeating x and y at the boundaries.

This includes editable regular and clifford toruses with standard radial or spiral quad generation both with the equivalent flat map representations so you can see how the uv mapping translates. The spiral map with integer twist factors will give perfect uv tiling still, just different world space coordinates on the torus which is helpful in different generations.

This is just a helpful math debugger for translating in other use cases as it's a somewhat unintuitive concept.
